# Pixart
A Python written algorithm that takes user input from the terminal and outputs the desired pixelated art using Python's Turtle üê¢.

The input must be between 0-9, and A-C. Furthermore, each input represents one row of the pixelated art therefore providing all input as one line is not advised.

## Example
Below is an example of how the art is generated. Upon running the code, the user is prompted to "Enter your color strings:", here, the user provides the input.

For example, to draw a Mario, provide the following input (not in one line):
  - [Mario_Pixart.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdullansari/Pixart/refs/heads/main/Mario_Pixart.txt)

That will produce a 20x20 picture of Mario, as shown below.

That's all there is to it. Try it for yourself and have fun!üî•
