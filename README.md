# Pixart
A Python written algorithim that takes user input from the terminal and outputs the desired pixelated art using Python's Turtle üê¢.

The input must be between 0-9, and A-C. Furthermore, each input represents one row of the pixelated art therefore providing all input as one line is not advised.

## Example
Below is an example of how the art is generated. Upon running the code, the user is prompted to "Enter your color strings:", here, the user provides the input.

For example, to draw a Mario, provide the following input (not in one line):

00000000000000000000
01111111111111111110
01111112222221111110
01111122222222211110
01111177778781111110
01111787888788811110
01111787788878881110
01111778888777711110
01111118888888111110
01111177277711111110
01111777277277711110
01117777222277771110
01118872822827881110
01118882222228881110
01118822222222881110
01111122211222111110
01111777111177711110
01117777111177771110
01111111111111111110
00000000000000000000

This will produce a 20x20 picture of Mario, as shown below.
